All configs, apps and the kernel in this repository are optimised for my hardware (since I am running Gentoo duh).

My specifications:

CPU: Intel i7-10700
GPU: Nvidia ROG Strix 1060 6GB, stock speeds
RAM: 4x8GB HyperX 2933MHz
Motherboard: ROG Strix B460-F Gaming
SSD: Sata III 480GB drive

The PSU, case and coolers are irrelevant to this, so I am not even gonna mention them.
